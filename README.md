# Leaf-Diease-Detection
 Developed an automated solution for detecting and classifying diseases in plant leaves, which is critical for agricultural  productivity and preventing widespread crop loss. 
The system is built upon a powerful ResNet (Residual Network) architecture, a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural 
Network known for its ability to train very deep networks effectively, leading to high accuracy in image recognition 
tasks 
By utilizing the ResNet model, the system is designed to analyze intricate visual patterns in leaf images, 
ultimately providing accurate and efficient disease diagnoses to assist farmers.
